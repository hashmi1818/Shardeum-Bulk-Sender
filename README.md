- **Chain ID**: `8080`
- **Block Explorer**: `https://explorer-unstable.shardeum.org`

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   This project uses a modern setup without a traditional build step, relying on `importmap` and CDN links.

### **Running Locally**

To serve the `index.html` file, you can use a simple local server:

1. **Install `serve` globally:**
   ```sh
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. **Run the server from the project's root directory:**
   ```sh
   serve .
   ```
   
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is busy).

## üìñ **How to Use the DApp**

- **ERC-20 Token**: Send any ERC-20 token by providing the contract address

### **3. Configure Token (ERC-20 Mode)**
- Paste the ERC-20 contract address
- DApp automatically fetches token details (name, symbol, decimals, balance)
- Visual confirmation when token is successfully loaded

### **4. Add Recipients**
- **Manual Input**: Paste addresses and amounts in the format `address, amount` per line
- **File Upload**: Upload CSV or TXT files with the same format
- **Smart Parsing**: Click "Parse Input" to validate and process the data

### **5. Review and Send**
- **Recipient List**: See all validated addresses and amounts
- **Transaction Summary**: Review total amount and verify sufficient balance
- **Batch Send**: Click "Send to X addresses" to begin the process
- **Sequential Signing**: Approve each transaction in MetaMask as prompted

### **6. Monitor Progress**
